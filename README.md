### Multi-Agent Trading System

Trading Zoo implements a sophisticated multi-agent trading environment powered by AutoGen, where AI agents engage in market activities through a central trading engine. Each animal team is represented by an autonomous LLaMA-based agent capable of processing market information and making independent trading decisions.

### Core Components

* **Trading Engine**
  * Centralized matching engine for order execution
  * Real-time orderbook management
  * Price discovery mechanism
  * Transaction logging and settlement

* **Market Maker Agent**
  * Provides baseline market liquidity
  * Maintains bid-ask spreads
  * Helps prevent extreme price volatility
  * Facilitates efficient price discovery

* **Trading Agents (Animal Teams)**
  * Each agent receives:
    * Current portfolio status
    * Real-time orderbook data
    * Market event notifications
    * Historical price data
  * Autonomous decision-making based on:
    * Team-specific trading strategies
    * Market conditions analysis
    * Risk management parameters
    * Portfolio objectives

### Implementation Details

* Built using AutoGen's multi-agent conversation framework
